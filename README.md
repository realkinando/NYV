# :currency_exchange:NYV Money
NYV (pronounced Naive) aims to serve as a platform to bootstrap liquidity for innovative, low cap, niche stablecoins.  
  
NYV does this by :
- Incentivising liquidity with our own platform tokens of the same peg, on Uniswap V2  
- Providing a foreign exchange simulating infinite liquidity depth 
  
**The aim is to open up the stablecoin market and bring DeFi to the world!  
BUIDLed for #HackMoney**

REALLY EARLY DAYS, I AM (@realKinando) CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS SOLO - WOULD LOVE FEEDBACK AND FOR PEOPLE TO JOIN ME  

Will add more to the readme soon, till then, DM me on Twitter to view the draft whitepaper :)

## NYV Assets
NYV Assets aim to securely match their peg by maintaining 1:1 pricing with a wide range of stablecoins of the same class. 
This is done by incentivising the maintaining of Uniswap (v2) reserves close to a target ratio.

## Depositors  
Depositor contracts receive source assets (e.g. UMA Derived Euro Synthetics, Dai, community fiat backed coin etc),
and debit the caller with the same amount of relevent NYV asset (NYV$,£,€,₹ etc). The source asset capital is then used to trade on uniswap.  
  
For this POC the depositor, SimpleDepositor.sol, simply takes the source capital and adds liquidity to the source asset | NYV asset pair - reverting if the source asset | NYV asset ratio < target. This is a really basic stability measure - we'll have to improve to go to production.  
  
Depositors are modular, and one source asset's depositor contract can be completely different to another.

## NYV Exchange
As most of DeFi is USD driven, and a huge use case for DeFi is remittances. NYV is being BUIDLed with a "Foreign Exchange" that has zero slippage.
Right now this being done by exchange.sol using a chainlink oracle to accordingly mint and burn NYV assets.

## The Demo
The demo is running on Rinkeby.
- Get some testnet Dai via the old UMA Token Builder Interface : https://tokenbuilder.umaproject.org/ViewPositions
- Add the various tokens to uniswapV2 manually
- Use your Dai to get NYV$ etc
- Approve the depositors to access your coins

The ABIs can be generated by cloning this repo and running following within the folder
```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/buidler
npx buidler compile
```

## Moving Forward
NYV needs much more comprehensive stabilisation measures to hold its peg. In addition, we would need a trusted decentralised organisation to assess the suitability of source assets.  
Many problems can be solved via the provision of a DAO; algorithmic burning & slashing of DAO tokens to hold pegs; and also via different depositor and exchange design.  

**This research will be discussed in the upcoming whitepaper.**
